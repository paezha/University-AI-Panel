	abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

	abstract = {Despite a large amount of critical research literature, traditional examinations continue to be widely used in higher education. This article reviews recent literature in order to assess the role played by the approaches adopted by researchers in the gap between research on exams, and the way exams are used. Viviane Robinson’s ‘problem-based methodology’ focuses on the need for researchers to engage with the challenges and priorities of practitioners. Drawing on Robinson’s approach, the article investigates how the strengths and weaknesses of exams and their alternatives are framed in the literature published between 2016 and 2021. The article concludes that there is an absence of evidence about how and why practitioners make decisions about assessment. This hinders the ability of assessment researchers to appropriately connect their work with the assessment challenges practitioners face. To make a difference, assessment research needs to live in the real world; a world which, at least as far as practitioners’ assessment decisions are concerned, we do not yet sufficiently understand.},

Now more complex AI-powered generation techniques produce texts indistinguishable from that of humans and the generation of scientific texts from a few keywords has been documented. Our study introduces the concept of tortured phrases: unexpected weird phrases in lieu of established ones, such as 'counterfeit consciousness' instead of 'artificial intelligence.' We combed the literature for tortured phrases and study one reputable journal where these concentrated en masse. Hypothesising the use of advanced language models we ran a detector on the abstracts of recent articles of this journal and on several control sets. The pairwise comparisons reveal a concentration of abstracts flagged as 'synthetic' in the journal. We also highlight irregularities in its operation, such as abrupt changes in editorial timelines. We substantiate our call for investigation by analysing several individual dubious articles, stressing questionable features: tortured writing style, citation of non-existent literature, and unacknowledged image reuse. Surprisingly, some websites offer to rewrite texts for free, generating gobbledegook full of tortured phrases. We believe some authors used rewritten texts to pad their manuscripts. We wish to raise the awareness on publications containing such questionable AI-generated or rewritten texts that passed (poor) peer review. Deception with synthetic texts threatens the integrity of the scientific literature.},

Informed by publicly available ‘open source’ data, the analysis delineates three key tactics that underpinned their disinformation campaign: account buying; ‘follower fishing’; and narrative switching. Both individually and collectively these were designed to build the reach, impact and influence of the ideologically loaded messages that social media account operators authored and amplified. The particular value of the analysis is that whilst a lot of recent public and political attention has focussed upon Kremlin backed disinformation in respect of the 2016 United States presidential election, far less work has addressed their European activities.},

	abstract = {The stated goal of many organizations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) is to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), an imagined system with more intelligence than anything we have ever seen. Without seriously questioning whether such a system can and should be built, researchers are working to create “safe AGI” that is “beneficial for all of humanity.” We argue that, unlike systems with specific applications which can be evaluated following standard engineering principles, undefined systems like “AGI” cannot be appropriately tested for safety. Why, then, is building AGI often framed as an unquestioned goal in the field of AI? In this paper, we argue that the normative framework that motivates much of this goal is rooted in the Anglo-American eugenics tradition of the twentieth century. As a result, many of the very same discriminatory attitudes that animated eugenicists in the past (e.g., racism, xenophobia, classism, ableism, and sexism) remain widespread within the movement to build AGI, resulting in systems that harm marginalized groups and centralize power, while using the language of “safety” and “benefiting humanity” to evade accountability. We conclude by urging researchers to work on defined tasks for which we can develop safety protocols, rather than attempting to build a presumably all-knowing system such as AGI.},

In the landscape of student evaluation, ungrading strategies respond to the limitations of traditional grading systems, particularly with respect to cultivating in-demand skills and capacities, such as adaptability, creative thinking, and self-management. Through in-depth interviews with eight students, this study reports on four experiential themes that characterize the switch to ungrading: de-gamification, or unsettling the “gamified” nature of evaluation in the traditional grading system; time to think and reflect, creating space for review and the deepening of learning; rich communication, or continual feedback between teacher and student; and learning community, in which students felt like they were part of a team effort rather than siloed individuals. Considerations for further research, as well as implementation of ungrading in other courses, are discussed.},

Results demonstrate White men were most likely to find the tweet uncivil and report it, and this was especially the case when the tweet came from a Black woman, regardless of the tone.

	abstract = {This article discusses five trends in research on writing as a learning activity. Firstly, earlier decades were marked by conflicting views about the effects of writing on learning; in the past decade, the use of meta-analysis has shown that the effects of writing on learning are reliable, and that several variables mediate and moderate these effects. Secondly, in earlier decades, it was thought that text as a medium inherently elicited thinking and learning. Research during the past decade has indicated that writing to learn is a self-regulated activity, dependent on the goals and strategies of the writer. Thirdly, the Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) movement emphasized domain-general approaches to WTL. Much recent research is consistent with the Writing in the Disciplines (WID) movement, incorporating genres that embody forms of reasoning specific to a given discipline. Fourthly, WTL as a classroom practice was always partially social, but the theoretical conceptualization of it was largely individual. During the past two decades, WTL has broadened to include theories and research that integrate social and psychological processes. Fifthly, WTL research has traditionally focused on epistemic learning in schools; more recently, it has been extended to include reflective learning in the professions and additional kinds of outcomes.},

	abstract = {This article proposes the concept ‘platformed racism’ as a new form of racism derived from the culture of social media platforms ‒ their design, technical affordances, business models and policies ‒ and the specific cultures of use associated with them. Platformed racism has dual meanings: first, it evokes platforms as amplifiers and manufacturers of racist discourse and second, it describes the modes of platform governance that reproduce (but that can also address) social inequalities. The national and medium specificity of platformed racism requires nuanced investigation. As a first step, I examined platformed racism through a particular national race-based controversy, the booing of the Australian Football League Indigenous star Adam Goodes, as it was mediated by Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Second, by using an issue mapping approach to social media analysis, I followed the different actors, themes and objects involved in this controversy to account for the medium specificity of platforms. Platformed racism unfolded in the Adam Goodes controversy as the entanglement between users’ practices to disguise and amplify racist humour and abuse, and the contribution of platforms’ features and algorithms in the circulation of overt and covert hate speech. In addition, the distributed nature of platforms’ editorial practices ‒ which involve their technical infrastructure, policies, moderators and users’ curation of content ‒ obscured the scope and type of this abuse. The paper shows that the concept of platformed racism challenges the discourse of neutrality that characterises social media platforms’ self-representations, and opens new theoretical terrain to engage with their material politics.},

We present a range of AI-based exercises that enable novel forms of practice and application including simulations, mentoring, coaching, and co-creation. For each type of exercise, we provide prompts that instructors can customize, along with guidance on classroom implementation, assessment, and risks to consider. We also provide blueprints, prompts that help instructors create their own original prompts. Instructors can leverage their content and pedagogical expertise to design these experiences, putting them in the role of builders and innovators. We argue that this instructor-driven approach has the potential to democratize the development of educational technology by enabling individual instructors to create AI exercises and tools tailored to their students' needs. While the exercises in this paper are a starting point, not a definitive solutions, they demonstrate AI's potential to expand what is possible in teaching and learning.},

This article explores how users make sense of the content moderation systems social media platforms use to curate this discourse. Through a survey of users (n = 519) who have experienced content moderation, I explore users’ folk theories of how content moderation systems work, how they shape the affective relationship between users and platforms, and the steps users take to assert their agency by seeking redress. I find significant impacts of content moderation that go far beyond the questions of freedom of expression that have thus far dominated the debate. Raising questions about what content moderation systems are designed to accomplish, I conclude by conceptualizing an educational, rather than punitive, model for content moderation systems.},

	abstract = {A revealing look at how negative biases against women of color are embedded in search engine results and algorithms Run a Google search for “black girls”—what will you find? “Big Booty” and other sexually explicit terms are likely to come up as top search terms. But, if you type in “white girls,” the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about “why black women are so sassy” or “why black women are so angry” presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society. In Algorithms of Oppression , Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color. Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance—operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond—understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance. An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.},

	abstract = {The argument advanced here, in a nutshell, is that this current age of austerity should not be viewed, as it is often cast, as exceptional, but should instead be understood as the natural order with respect to government attitudes to socio-economic rights. To put it slightly differently: in the context of an economic and social system which invariably privileges numerically small, elite groups within society, both at the domestic and global level, commitments to socio-economic rights are only ever formal, and honoured in the most grudging and limited of ways. Or, returning to the title of this chapter, in an economic and political order premised on the privileging of the few at the expense of the many, governments are happy to agree to allow everyone to “eat cake”, so long as each atomistic market actor is ready to secure it for his or herself. One important consequence of this, is that the language of socio-economic rights, and consequently the various interests related to and protected by them, tends not to feature in decision-making processes about the size and share of the national resources cake. Therefore, in seeking to take what silver lining their may be from the current crisis, we need to look at ways of democratising such decision-making processes, to provide at least the possibility that socio-economic rights, and the interests associated with them, will figure in the calculus.},

	abstract = {Recent studies show that large language models (LLM) unintendedly memorize part of the training data, which brings serious privacy risks. For example, it has been shown that over 1\% of tokens generated unprompted by an LLM are part of sequences in the training data. However, current studies mainly focus on the exact memorization behaviors. In this paper, we propose to evaluate how many generated texts have near-duplicates (e.g., only differ by a couple of tokens out of 100) in the training corpus. A major challenge of conducting this evaluation is the huge computation cost incurred by near-duplicate sequence searches. This is because modern LLMs are trained on larger and larger corpora with up to 1 trillion tokens. What's worse is that the number of sequences in a text is quadratic to the text length. To address this issue, we develop an efficient and scalable near-duplicate sequence search algorithm in this paper. It can find (almost) all the near-duplicate sequences of the query sequence in a large corpus with guarantees. Specifically, the algorithm generates and groups the min-hash values of all the sequences with at least t tokens (as very short near-duplicates are often irrelevant noise) in the corpus in linear time to the corpus size. We formally prove that only 2 n+1/t+1 -1 min-hash values are generated for a text with n tokens in expectation. Thus the index time and size are reasonable. When a query arrives, we find all the sequences sharing enough min-hash values with the query using inverted indexes and prefix filtering. Extensive experiments on a few large real-world LLM training corpora show that our near-duplicate sequence search algorithm is efficient and scalable.},

Representing a scholarly dialogue among established and emerging critical media and information studies scholars, this volume provides a means of foregrounding new questions, methods, and theories which can be applied to digital media, platforms, and infrastructures. These inquiries include, among others, how representation to hardware, software, computer code, and infrastructures might be implicated in global economic, political, and social systems of control. Contributors argue that more research needs to explicitly trace the types of uneven power relations that exist in technological spaces. By looking at both the broader political and economic context and the many digital technology acculturation processes as they are differentiated intersectionally, a clearer picture emerges of how under-acknowledging culturally situated and gendered information technologies are impacting the possibility of participation with (or purposeful abstinence from) the Internet. This book is ideal for undergraduate and graduate courses in Internet studies, library and information studies, communication, sociology, and psychology. It is also ideal for researchers with varying expertise and will help to advance theoretical and methodological approaches to Internet research.},

	abstract = {Trained on billions of images, diffusion-based text-to-image models seem impervious to traditional data poisoning attacks, which typically require poison samples approaching 20\% of the training set. In this paper, we demonstrate the surprising result that state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models are in fact highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Our work is driven by two key insights. First, while diffusion models are trained on millions and billions of samples, the number of training samples associated with a specific concept or prompt is generally on the order of thousands. This suggests that these models will be vulnerable to prompt-specific poisoning attacks that corrupt a model's ability to respond to specific targeted prompts. Second, poison samples can be carefully crafted to maximize poison potency to ensure success with very few samples. We introduce Nightshade, a prompt-specific poisoning attack optimized for potency that can completely control the output of a prompt in Stable Diffusion's newest model (SDXL) with less than 100 poisoned training samples. Hemlock also generates stealthy poison images that look visually identical to their benign counterparts, and produces poison effects that "bleed through" to related concepts. More importantly, a moderate number of Hemlock attacks on independent prompts can destabilize a model and disable its ability to generate images for any and all prompts. Finally, we propose the use of Hemlock and similar tools as a defense for content owners against web scrapers that ignore opt-out/do-not-crawl directives, and discuss potential implications for both model trainers and content owners.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has an “AI” problem. With new breathtaking capabilities from generative AI released every several months — and AI hype escalating at an even higher rate — it’s high time we differentiate most of today’s practical ML projects from those research advances. This begins by correctly naming such projects: Call them “ML,” not “AI.” Including all ML initiatives under the “AI” umbrella oversells and misleads, contributing to a high failure rate for ML business deployments. For most ML projects, the term “AI” goes entirely too far — it alludes to human-level capabilities. In fact, when you unpack the meaning of “AI,” you discover just how overblown a buzzword it is: If it doesn’t mean artificial general intelligence, a grandiose goal for technology, then it just doesn’t mean anything at all.},

	abstract = {VANET technology is an essential component of Intelligent Transportation Systems, which makes c communication between moving cars and stationary Road Side Units more accessible. It allows vehicle nodes to share crucial data among communication devices. VANET has significant potential to enhance traffic efficiency and road safety. This is accomplished by decreasing the chances of collisions between vehicles and reducing the number of accidents. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are a crucial issue in VANET which needs significant consideration from researchers. To solve the problem of man-in-the-middle attacks, this article presents a dynamic and optimized routing approach for VANET conversation in smart cities by utilizing a chaotic secure multi-verse optimization algorithm. The strategy that has been proposed seeks to achieve the goal of ensuring safe and effective interaction between vehicles participating in VANETs by dynamically determining the optimal path for the exchange of data. A chaotic protect multi-verse optimization approach is used to generate several random sequences from which the most secure route may be selected. This is done to enhance the security of the VANET transmission network during transmission. The results of the trials indicate that the suggested technique is more successful in avoiding MITM and improving the functioning of VANET connections in settings that are characterized by intelligent cities.},

	abstract = {In this quickly developing world, automatic currency identification and recognition are crucial tasks. Several financial institutions, such as banks and hardware-based devices such as vending machines and slot machines, play an essential role in all monetary unification fields. Accurate coin recognition is essential in various contexts, including vending machines, currency exchange, and archaeological research. However, the distinctive visual characteristics of Brazilian coins, including variations in size, color, and design, pose significant challenges for automated classification. Most of the existing currency recognition systems are based on the physical properties of the currencies, such as length, breadth, and mass. At the same time, image-based methods rely on other properties like color, shape, and edge. This paper presents a novel deep-learning framework tailored to classify Brazilian coins. Our proposed deep learning framework leverages state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to address these challenges. We introduce a Repetitive Feature Extractor Convolution Neural Network (RFE-CNN) model to recognize the currency faster and accurately. Our framework employs a multi-stage approach for coin classification. First, a pre-processing module handles coin localization and image enhancement to mitigate variations in lighting and background. Next, an RFE-CNN-based feature extractor extracts discriminative features from the coin images. We explore transfer learning from pre-trained models to enhance the model’s generalization capability, given limited data availability. We used a comprehensive dataset of Brazilian coins, comprising various denominations, minting years, and conditions, to facilitate model training and evaluation. The dataset includes high-resolution images captured under diverse lighting and environmental conditions, ensuring robust model performance in real-world scenarios. In conclusion, our proposed deep learning framework offers a powerful and efficient solution for classifying Brazilian coins. The framework’s adaptability makes it a valuable tool for recognizing coins from other regions with similar visual diversity and variability challenges. The proposed model has achieved a classification accuracy of 98.34\% for the classification of Brazilian coins.},

The perceived increased use of continuous assessment periodically captures media attention, with claims of greater numbers of higher degree classifications being awarded. This paper takes a case-study approach to investigate the extent to which different types of assessment allow students to effectively demonstrate and apply their learning. By considering data gathered from second-level, undergraduate students completing 60 point, online psychology modules, this paper investigates assessment effectiveness in terms of student satisfaction, pass rate and level of pass rate. Findings reveal that modules with an end of module assessment (EMA), rather than an examination, have higher completion and pass rates. Whilst students who took a seen examination also performed well, those who completed an unseen examination recorded the lowest overall pass and completion rates, despite high ratings of student satisfaction. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for improved pedagogy and student experience.},

	abstract = {Despite the expanding literature in the last three decades on modes of implementation and the various forms of formal and informal assessments, there is limited evidence of academics’ knowledge and understanding of continuous assessment practice. Using a mixed methods sequential explanatory research design, this paper aimed to investigate academics’ knowledge and understanding of the structure of continuous assessment and its application in supporting students’ learning experiences at a South African University of Technology. The results of this study provide the basis to initiate deeper discussions on developing shared understandings of assessment literacy, assessment bunching, and assessment validity and reliability. These elements are all required for the enhancement of quality assurance and monitoring of fit for purpose continuous assessment practices.},

We forecast the growing demand for training data based on current trends and estimate the total stock of public human text data. Our findings indicate that if current LLM development trends continue, models will be trained on datasets roughly equal in size to the available stock of public human text data between 2026 and 2032, or slightly earlier if models are overtrained. We explore how progress in language modeling can continue when human-generated text datasets cannot be scaled any further. We argue that synthetic data generation, transfer learning from data-rich domains, and data efficiency improvements might support further progress.},

Now they're planning to spend tens of billions more, pushing up demand for computer chips and potentially adding new strain to the U.S. electrical grid. In quarterly earnings calls this week, Google, Microsoft and Meta all underlined just how big their investments in AI are. On Wednesday, Meta raised its predictions for how much it will spend this year by up to \$10 billion. Google plans to spend around \$12 billion or more each quarter this year on capital expenditures, much of which will be for new data centers, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said Thursday. Microsoft spent \$14 billion in the most recent quarter and expects that to keep increasing "materially," Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said.},

	abstract = {A large language model (LLM) is a computational model notable for its ability to achieve general-purpose language generation and other natural language processing tasks such as classification. Based on language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process. LLMs can be used for text generation, a form of generative AI, by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word.
LLMs are artificial neural networks. The largest and most capable, as of March 2024, are built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture.
Up to 2020, fine tuning was the only way a model could be adapted to be able to accomplish specific tasks. Larger sized models, such as GPT-3, however, can be prompt-engineered to achieve similar results. They are thought to acquire knowledge about syntax, semantics and "ontology" inherent in human language corpora, but also inaccuracies and biases present in the corpora.
Some notable LLMs are OpenAI's GPT series of models (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, used in ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot), Google's Gemini (the latter of which is currently used in the chatbot of the same name), Meta's LLaMA family of models, Anthropic's Claude models, and Mistral AI's models.},

	abstract = {Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in generating textual responses from visual inputs, yet their versatility raises significant security concerns. This study takes the first step in exposing VLMs' susceptibility to data poisoning attacks that can manipulate responses to innocuous, everyday prompts. We introduce Shadowcast, a stealthy data poisoning attack method where poison samples are visually indistinguishable from benign images with matching texts. Shadowcast demonstrates effectiveness in two attack types. The first is Label Attack, tricking VLMs into misidentifying class labels, such as confusing Donald Trump for Joe Biden. The second is Persuasion Attack, which leverages VLMs' text generation capabilities to craft narratives, such as portraying junk food as health food, through persuasive and seemingly rational descriptions. We show that Shadowcast are highly effective in achieving attacker's intentions using as few as 50 poison samples. Moreover, these poison samples remain effective across various prompts and are transferable across different VLM architectures in the black-box setting. This work reveals how poisoned VLMs can generate convincing yet deceptive misinformation and underscores the importance of data quality for responsible deployments of VLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/umd-huang-lab/VLM-Poisoning.},
